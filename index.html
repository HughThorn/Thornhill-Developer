        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Hugh and welcome to my webpage. I'm a former photographer, writer, and am currently learning to become a full-stack web developer.</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Honolulu, HI, and graduated from Mid-Pacific Institute in 2010. I then went to Sarah Lawrence College where I pursued a BA in photography and journalism.
        <p>Upon graduating, I moved to NYC and decided to work as a game journalist for a little over a year. However, I decided it was not the career path I wanted to pursue. So I switched gears and worked as a chef for about a year and a half.</p>
        <p>Life wasn't treating me all that well in the food industry though, so I decided that it was time for another career change. After consulting friends who were in the tech industry, pursuing in careers such as software engineering and app development, I decided to learn how to code. I've found it to be a much more engaging and decided to pursue a career in web development. Over time, I'll be updating this site with my work so you can all watch me grow as a web developer!
